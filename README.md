# Button-Controlled LED Project

This project demonstrates how to control an LED using two pushbuttons. The LED turns on when either of the pushbuttons is pressed. It is achieved using an Arduino board, pushbuttons, and an LED.

## Description

The project involves reading the states of two pushbuttons (`buttonPin_1` and `buttonPin_2`) using the Arduino's digital input pins. The LED (`ledPin`) is connected to a digital output pin. The program continuously checks the state of both pushbuttons, and if either of them is pressed (high), the LED is turned on. Otherwise, the LED remains off.

## Components

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- 2x pushbuttons
- 1x LED
- Resistors (if needed)

## Circuit Diagram

Insert a circuit diagram here that shows how the pushbuttons and LED are connected to the Arduino.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
3. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.
4. Open the Arduino IDE.
5. Open the `button_controlled_led.ino` file from the repository in the Arduino IDE.
6. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. After uploading the code to your Arduino board, press either of the pushbuttons.
2. Observe that the LED turns on when either of the pushbuttons is pressed.
3. Release the pushbutton to turn off the LED.
